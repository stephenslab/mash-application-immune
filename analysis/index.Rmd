* Simulations to compare the results of Exchangeable Effects and Exchangeable Z-scores model
  
    [Compare EE and EZ](CompareZBeta.html)
  
    The correct model has higher likelihood in simulations.
    
Here is the `MASH` analyses:

* Generate the covariance matrices

    + [EZ covariance matrices](Immune_Cov_EZ.html)
    + [EE covariance matrices](Immune_Cov_EE.html)
    
    I realized a question here. We run the `cov_ed` using mash data and Ulist. The mash data has `Bhat`, `Shat`, `Shat_alpha`, `V`, `alpha`. In `cov_ed`, it only use the `Bhat` and `Shat`. Therefore, it assumes the errors are independent (V is identity). The `cov_ed` algorithm does not account for the V matrix. 
    
    We use extreme deconvolution to find the covariance candidates. Maybe, the ignorance of the dependency in ed does not matter. Will including the dependency improve the initial covariance matrices?
    
* Fit the `mash` model
    + [EZ V1 mash model](Immune_Data_Mash_V1_EZ.html)
    + [EE V1 mash model](Immune_Data_Mash_V1_EE.html)
    
    Changing the parameter `alpha` could obtain EE or EZ fitted model.
    
    Changing the parameter `vhat` could obtain different V matrices.
      + `vhat = 0`, V is identity matrix
      + `vhat = 1`, V is the estimated correlation matrix
      
      V is the correlation matrix here:
      $$ \hat{\beta}_{j}|\beta_{j}, S_{j} \sim N(\hat{\beta}_{j}; \beta_{j}, S_{j}VS_{j}) $$
    
* Results:
    + [EZ V1 model](Immune_Data_Mash_V1_EZ_Result.html)
    + [EE V1 model](Immune_Data_Mash_V1_EE_Result.html)
    + [EZ V0 model](Immune_Data_Mash_V0_EZ_Result.html)
    + [EE V0 model](Immune_Data_Mash_V0_EE_Result.html)
    
    The estimated weights for covariance matrices are different for EE and EZ model when V is the estimated correlation. When V is Identity, the estimated weights are similar. But the measurements are correlated due to sample overlap (all based on same 134 individuals), I think it is reasonable to use the estimated correlation from the data (V1).
    
    Among these models, EZ V1 has the highest log likelihood value.
    
    Using Mash with V be the estimated correlation, we found more eQTLs, the number of eQTLs are similar using EE and EZ model. Based on the EZ V1 model, the majority weights for the covariance matrix is on the null matrix (0, no effects, 84.6%). The remaining weights are on the covariance matrix capturing the pattern that the standardized effects are strong positively correlated among all treatments (14.5%). The covariance component $11'$ (5.4%) shows that the standardized effects are similar. The other covariance component has the formate $D11'D$ (9.1%), D is a diagnoal matrix, which means the standardized effects are different in size, but they are strongly correlated ($\beta_{lpa6h} = d *  \beta_{ctrl}$ etc.).
    
    The mash fit favors component where **standardized** effects are very similar, which does not mean the raw effects are similar. The similarity of standardized effects could imply the similarity of raw effects if and only if the standard errors of the estimated effects are all similar. The derivation is in [Mash Posterior under non-equal $s_{jr}$](PostNONsd.html). In this dataset, the $s_{jr}$ are not similar aross treatments. The `equal effect` covariance structure (correlation) is for the **standardized** effects. The raw effects have the same correlation structure, but with different covariance, different mean.
    
    We found a lot reQTLs (raw effect), treatment specific reQTLs and time point specific reQTLs using the linear transformation. We found more reQTLs, treatment specific reQTLs and time point specific reQTLs than the paper’s result.
    
    However, the number of reQTLs from EE model are much less than EZ model. I don’t know the reason for this.
    
* If we define the reQTL as **different standardized effects**, the result is [EZ V1 model reQTL](Immune_Data_Mash_V1_EZ_reQTLs.html).
    
    The number of reQTLs are fewer than the original reQTLs.

* The plot of logFC:
    
    The y axis is logFC = $log_{2} \frac{mean \ sti}{mean \ base}$. The x axis is the group of genes: 'eQTL in both baseline and the stimulate', 'eQTL in baseline', 'eQTL in stimulate'.
    
    [EZ V1 eQTL logFC](Immune_Data_Mash_V1_EZ_Compare.html)
    
    The logFC in different groups are similar. 
    
    Here, the x axis is: 'eQTL only in baseline', 'eQTL only in stimulate'.
    
    [EZ V1 eQTL logFC ONLY thresh=0.05](Immune_Data_Mash_V1_EZ_CompareONLY_0.05.html)
    
    [EZ V1 eQTL logFC ONLY thresh=0.01](Immune_Data_Mash_V1_EZ_CompareONLY_0.01.html)
    
    [EZ V1 eQTL logFC ONLY thresh=0.001](Immune_Data_Mash_V1_EZ_CompareONLY_0.001.html)
    
    The logFC in 'eQTL only in stimulate' group is slightly higher.
    
    The differences become clearer as we concentrate on more convincingly baseline/stimulate-specific eQTLs. 
    
    Method: Within the baseline/stimulate-specific group, select the more convincingly eQTLSs by decreasing the statistical significance cutoff.
